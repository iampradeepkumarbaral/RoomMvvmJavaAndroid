# Android-java-MVVM-with-RoomDatabase-Retrofit-and-RecyclerView

we are going to build a simple project with the help of Room Database , ViewModal , LiveData and Retrofit. So, What is the agenda of this project? 
        
First we will send a retrofit request to the web server for json data, then after fetching json data from the server , we will store that data into Room Database and then shows into the recyclerview. Alright! 
        
  What is the benefits of saving data into Room Database?
      
   so guys here Room Database means your local storage of your mobile so, whenever we don't have internet, your application can fetch data from your local storage(Room Database).
